# Answer

## Question

**mod.io** has developed a new lambda script that needs specific permissions to talk to RDS from within a VPC. It only needs to be accessed and called from within the mod.io cloud environment. In the staging environment, a prototype has been built complete with:

- **Lambda function** on nodejs
- **Function URL**
- **IAM user** with access key + secret to `rds:*`
- **Log group**

You have been assigned a task in the project management tool to take this prototype into a templated application in Github with deployments with lint tests that must pass before PR's can be sent into the main branch.

**Walk us through the steps involved in converting the prototype into a production service, including feedback to the development team, any changes or additions you would make, and a sample cloudformation snippet (not exhaustive) that covers the resources you will create and how it interacts with existing resources as well as an example github action to deploy the CFN.**

## Answer

### 🔍 **Prototype Analysis**

**mod.io** created a functional prototype consisting of a Lambda function (Node.js) with access to an RDS database via Function URL. However, it had several critical issues:

❌ **Used an IAM user with hardcoded credentials**  
❌ **Had no CI/CD pipeline or validations**  
❌ **Was exposed via a public Function URL**  
❌ **Lacked any guardrails or governance around deployment**

### 🎯 **Objective**

My task was to convert this prototype into a **secure, production-ready, templated service** with complete GitHub-based automation and gated pull request processes.

## 🚀 **Steps Taken to Productionize the Service**

### ✅ **1. Security & Architectural Feedback to Developers**

#### 🔐 **Credential Management**
- **Replaced IAM user** with an IAM role assigned to the Lambda
- **Migrated database credentials** to AWS Secrets Manager
- **Eliminated hardcoded secrets** from the codebase

#### 🌐 **Access Control**
- **Updated Function URL** from `AuthType: NONE` to `AuthType: AWS_IAM`
- **Restricted access** to authenticated callers only
- **Implemented VPC isolation** for enhanced security

#### 🧠 **Observability & Reliability**
- **Introduced structured logging** with CloudWatch integration
- **Added TCP-based RDS connectivity testing**
- **Implemented CloudWatch alarms** for monitoring
- **Enhanced error handling** and troubleshooting capabilities

#### 🧱 **Infrastructure as Code**
- **All infrastructure codified** using modular CloudFormation templates
- **Environment-specific configurations** (dev/staging/prod)
- **Version-controlled deployments** with rollback capability

---

### ✅ **2. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**

I implemented a **multi-stage GitHub Actions pipeline** to validate, secure, and deploy the infrastructure, comprising:

#### 🧪 **A. Pull Request Validation Pipeline** *(Pull Request Checks)*

This workflow enforces **shift-left security**, syntax, and dependency validation before any merge to the main branch:

##### **Key Jobs:**

**`validate-changes`:**
- ✅ Detects and lints only **changed CloudFormation templates**
- ✅ Validates CFN syntax using **AWS CLI**
- ✅ Prevents invalid templates from being merged

**`security-scan-pr`:**
- ✅ Runs **Checkov** for IaC security scanning
- ✅ Publishes results to **GitHub's Security tab**
- ✅ Identifies potential security vulnerabilities

**`test-scripts`:**
- ✅ Validates **.sh and .json files** using `bash -n` and `jq`
- ✅ Ensures script syntax correctness
- ✅ Prevents deployment of broken scripts

**`check-deployment-order`:**
- ✅ Analyzes use of **`Fn::ImportValue`** to ensure proper stack dependencies
- ✅ Ensures stacks like `vpc-stack` and `rds-stack` are created before being referenced
- ✅ Prevents **cross-stack dependency issues**

**`generate-pr-summary`:**
- ✅ Creates a **human-readable summary** of PR impact including:
  - 📋 **Changed resources**
  - ✅ **Validation results**
  - 🎯 **Deployment targets**
  - 📝 **Next steps for reviewers**

#### 🚀 **B. Deployment Workflow** *(on main or develop branches)*

Pull requests that pass all checks can be merged into `develop` or `main`, triggering the infrastructure deployment pipeline, which includes:

**Pre-Deployment Validation:**
- ✅ **Linting & Validation**
- ✅ **Checkov Security Scans**
- ✅ **Script & JSON Syntax Tests**

**Staged Deployment to:**
- 🧪 **Staging** from `develop` branch
- 🏭 **Production** from `main` branch

**Each Environment Deployment Includes:**
- 🌐 **VPC + Private Subnets**
- 🗄️ **RDS Instance**
- 🔐 **Secrets Manager Stack**
- ⚡ **Lambda Function in VPC**
- 🔄 **Automated RDS Endpoint Injection into Secrets**
- 🧪 **Lambda-RDS Connectivity Tests**

## 📋 **Summary and Value Delivered**

### ✅ **Infrastructure Transformation**
- **Prototype converted** into modular, reusable infrastructure-as-code
- **Environment isolation** with staging/production separation
- **Version-controlled deployments** with rollback capability

### ✅ **Security Enhancements**
- **Lambda Function** is now secure, VPC-attached, and credential-free
- **IAM authentication** required for Function URL access
- **Secrets management** eliminates hardcoded credentials
- **Security scanning** integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### ✅ **CI/CD Automation**
- **GitHub Actions pipelines** orchestrate testing, validation, and deployment
- **Pull requests** are now guarded with security and validation gates
- **Automated testing** ensures infrastructure reliability
- **Deployment governance** through branch-based rules

### ✅ **Developer Experience**
- **Reviewers get automated PR summary** reports outlining changes and validation
- **Shift-left security** catches issues before deployment
- **Clear deployment feedback** and troubleshooting information
- **Standardized development workflow**
